# Documentation #

  * For the time being, we use a good old commenting that is difficult to track. We need to improve commenting and documentation (i.e : doxygen)

# Missing methods #

  * All the Artist methods.
  * Charts methods.
  * Identifier methods.

# Improvements #

  * Better error handling (almost inexistent now).
  * Another notification mode. We are using NSNotification. Maybe we need to implement a delegate protocol.
  * Find a way to update upload status (percentage) for the MP3 uploading method.
  * URL "upload" for tracks
